## Project Inspiration

The **She AI** hackathon is more than just a competition; it's a movement to change the world for women and girls using the power of technology. Inspired by the **UN's Sustainable Development Goal 5**, this initiative is rooted in the belief that **gender equality** is not just a fundamental human right, but a critical foundation for a peaceful, prosperous, and sustainable world.

The idea behind this project is to empower participants to tackle real-world issues that disproportionately affect women and girls, like gender-based violence, unequal opportunities, and limited access to resources. With the support of **Google’s advanced AI tools**, participants have the chance to create solutions that drive tangible social change. Whether you're developing a system to combat online harassment, promote women’s leadership, or provide women with more accessible healthcare tools, your work can inspire and create a ripple effect of positive impact.

This hackathon is an invitation to be part of something larger—an opportunity to not only sharpen your technical skills but to make a difference in the lives of millions of women and girls worldwide. Your project could be the next breakthrough innovation that changes lives, shifts societal norms, and accelerates the global movement towards **gender equality**.
